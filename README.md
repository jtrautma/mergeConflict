# mergeConflict

This repository should produce a merge conflict. On the master branch the "name" file has no name variable assigned. Then 2 branches are forked, Jason and Jessica, each assigning a different name as value to the variable "myName". Merging the branch "Jessica" to the joint "jessicaJasonMergeConflict" branch wasn't a problem. However, the pull request for merging "Jason" to "jessicaJasonMergeConflict" then indicates a merge conflict since it is unclear what my name really is -- am I called Jessica or Jason?
